# This Flask app has been converted to a static site for GitHub Pages deployment
# The main file is now index.html in the root directory
# To run locally with Flask, uncomment the code below:

# from flask import Flask, render_template
# app = Flask(__name__)
# @app.route("/")
# def index():
#     return render_template("index.html")
# if __name__ == '__main__':
#     app.run(debug=True)
